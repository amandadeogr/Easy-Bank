## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Atomic Design
- BEM

### What I learned
When I saw this challenge, I immediately got interested in doing it. The look of the page was something I had never done before, and it was my first intermediate level challenge. The code that I liked the most was the mobile menu part, because it was the first time I did it from scratch and without consulting the internet.

### Continued development

My next goals is to study more about pseudo classes in CSS, and turn some parts of html code into JS code.
